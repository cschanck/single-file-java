The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. 

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.","0","0","0"

Not quite the same as Chinatown in terms of pricing (slightly higher) but definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood. When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.

For Valentine's Day my boyfriend had ordered roses with Tidy's. However, the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered. He had placed in an order for long stem roses, mixed with orchids and was charged for that. What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers. 

In speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.

Understanding that Valentine's Day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen, the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature.","9","0","1"

Service here is not great, it felt like they had forgotten about us and that they didn't care about the service as everything came out one at a time. My friend and I had each ordered a ginger beer, which came out at two separate times (it was almost as if they had to go in the back and make it themselves - that's how long it took).

There is absolutely no vegetarian options, except for the one cold noodle - the mushroom bun is not vegetarian.

The pork belly bun was nothing special - just a piece of meat with the bun. For my vegetarian friend, we had ordered the bun plain so she could experience it as well, and they literally just gave it to us plain, with no sauce, no kimchi.

The Momofuko ramen was awful. It was bland and mushy. After a few bites, I couldn't handle eating anymore.

Momofuko is not the place to go if you want real ramen. I've had better experience with instant noodles.","9","2","1"

one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads. Just let the server know when you come in.

excited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are salads. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't salads on the menu.

So we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave). 

In reading the reviews, everyone thought very highly of the mac and cheese and poutine, we had ordered that to try. It wasn't bad, but not sure what the hype was about. Definitely pretty rich and filling and made for sharing!","1","0","0"

Surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available.

Definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there, stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste, just coconut favour. But the Roti itself was really good.

The pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in (as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold).

For the 1st time users, they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do, that way you don't scared them off from swimming.

We happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for bubble tea, so we decided to grab a few to go.

First of all, the two menus is located in a very awkward place (one very high up on the wall and one in the corner also by the wall), set up is not really friendly neither can it accommodate a large group of people to look at the menu at the same time.

The menu items itself had different options than your typically bubble tea place. Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. 

For a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).

The service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.

We had ordered the following:
- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)
- peach ice tea
- roasted oolong milk tea
- supernova kumquat lemonade

And when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. 

The mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.

I guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.

Also - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...

We will definitely not be returning...","0","0","0"

It was definitely different and worth the wait. 

We started off with the House Cured Meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people).

Next came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering. Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!

Then came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.

Tongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.

For dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting. It was good, but after 4 dishes already, this was just a little too rich. It came with banana bread that was really good.

Overall, definitely worth the try! Just make sure you bring cash =)","0","0","0"

Looking at their menu,  we wanted to try everything! the French toast, the strawberry shortcakes..donuts (they were sold out by the time we got there).

but we wind up only ordering two things: 

the classic - 2 eggs any style, house cured bacon or sage and onion sausage, crispy griddled red skin potatoes with sea salt and thyme. Served with toast of your choice. Upgrade your toast to a buttermilk biscuit 

Emma's Benny - Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, poached eggs and smothered in mousselline sauce. Served with a side of griddled red skin potatoes.

big portions - really good!

We were a little late for our appt, but we had called ahead to notify them (only to get the answering machine). When we got there, the receptionist was rude and said, typically we don't take appts that are this late, as we are booked back to back, but this time we will take you in. And when we looked around the salon, there was only 2 other people getting their nails done.

The two girls that did our nails were really nice. My friend kept smudging her almost dried nails, so they had fixed it for her twice.

we were really excited, as when we were in NYC, we had really good ramen. 

listening to the reviews we started off with the gyoza appetizer - which was not as good as everyone says it is. It was pan fried with the thin layer of skin, but there was an aftertaste of soap water. Which I should have known, since the glass of water they served us was disgusting!

We had ordered the jumbo sumo ramen - beware, it is a very big bowl of noodles, which we did not expect.

First of all, when we made reservations, they only had a 7pm time slot for us (we were looking for 8pm) and when we were there, we were seated in the lower area of the restaurant, which was pretty empty.

There was an extensive menu, everything on the menu sound good, but when we got our food - there was nothing special, especially for what we paid for it. 

The pizza's are huge portions - so if you order it, make sure you share it.

There are 3 risottos on the menu, the seasonal vegetable one is the better one. Some of the pastas were portioned differently, some were huge, others were tiny - so be careful!

The food came out really fast after we ordered, so fast, that some of the food was cold (not sure if they make it in advance and just heat up afterwards). The desserts took forever to come.

At the end of the night when the bill came, there was a water service charge ($12.50) for 9 people for just getting tap water. And 18% gratuity after taxes.

- types of noodles
- 1 hot drink is included but other options have an additional charge

Then you also have an option of adding side items.

Immediately after purchasing the vehicle I began having to make out of pocket repairs to the suspension, brakes and exhaust system every 6 to 9 months with absolutely no clue as to why after all the repairs the car still drove somewhat unsteady at high speeds. 
    Two years after I bought the car I was finally sick of the constant problems and decided to trade it in with another dealership, during the trade in process I found out that Planet Nissan had sold the vehicle to me knowing that it was involved in a ""major"" car accident which caused frame damage six months prior to them selling it to me.
Unfortunately there's not much I can do now, but I would advise any savvy consumer to avoid this dealership by all means possible and go someplace that is a bit more reputable!","0","0","0"

It had just opened when I started going and I walked in off the street because I figured I'd take a chance, it looked clean and it was close to home. 
I was greeted by the owner, a pleasant Chinese woman, who did my nails that day. Since then, I've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures. Those are the only things I've had done, but I would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well. 
The spa is new and everything is spacious and clean. They have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable. 
It's a basic nail place, so the bells and whistles are not numerous, but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down, allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly. 
Some of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others, but no one does a bad job. I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. 
In this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business. Good for them AND for me! 
Some of the services they give include manicures, pedicures, gel nails, waxing, threading, eyebrow tinting and ear candles.","15","1","5"

I have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it's always been sub-par. Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.

So I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be ""rejected"" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! 

So I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance. Not worth it at ALL.","2","1","0"

My expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. 

The last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. 

The waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, ""The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!"" 

It took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....

We played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!

The food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous ""Boom frites"" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! 

Anyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better! 

Oh, and I disagree that it's a good place for a group. Unless you want to wait forever...or make a group by joining another couple at their picnic table!","2","0","1"

Both are good, but I really love that pulled pork poutine. The BBQ sauce they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the fries and cheese curds. A large poutine is more than enough for two people and I liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls. I guess my only criticism is that they need more seating. Both times I've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving, but it's gross out on the street and this summer anyway, it's been SO hot outside. They don't have space for more seats, so this isn't really something they can easily fix, but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments?

They would send you home with some dye remover wrapped in tin foil, to wipe it away. This sort of stuff can be overlooked if the job is excellent, but it was always just good.

A few years ago, Sheppard Centre was an alright place. When I lived at Yonge and Sheppard, there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st Sheppard Centre and it was good. 

Sheppard Centre is at a major subway stop, in a hugely busy area, but somehow stores keep failing here. 

That being the case, there are a few stores that are nice and handy. I would consider this mall for errands, now that I live away...except that the major reason for coming is gone now.

Sheppard Centre used to have 1 hour of free parking, which is a huge draw. You could go and park, run in and pick up your mail, or something from Shoppers Drug Mart and be on your way. They got rid of that. Not only that, but it's $3.50 for half an hour or under!

I think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall. 

""OH, but they have to pay for their excellent staff!"" you say?

Yeah, let me tell you about the staff that work there. First of all, you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down ALL THE TIME, so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth, park in the non-parking spots, block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office...an office with TV screens of the parking garage, where our car has been broken into before...but it's not their fault. There are SIGNS that say they are not liable. Soooo...what are the TV screens for? To WATCH peoples' cars get broken into and laugh?

Right, so back to the story! 

Before I knew what to do when the machines broke down, I went to the in-mall security\/info booth to ask. The guy was behind the booth, on the phone, having a personal conversation. He saw me, but turned away and continued for ten minutes. Finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over...only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers. Finally I called out and said, ""Excuse me?"" He told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible.

This isn't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before. Dogs are allowed in the subway, so I was walking through once, to the subway entrance, HOLDING my dog, in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed. I told him I was just heading to the subway, so he followed me there to make sure. Yeah, because I really wanted to take my dog to the dollarstore and was clearly lying. GO STOP PEOPLE FROM BREAKING INTO CARS! 

Bayview Village, down the street, or one subway stop over, has a Shoppers, a grocery store, a post office, a Blacks photography and clothing stores...like Sheppard Centre. It also has a Chapters with a Starbucks, an LCBO, GOOD restaurants and the people there are polite, the bathrooms nicer than mine at home AND parking is free.

So basically Sheppard Centre can bite me. I'm done with them.","11","10","3"

We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: ""The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.""
We looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.
Now, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.
Rooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that ""all the rooms have been updated in SOME way""...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!
The hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.

Hotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.

Service: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.

The thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.

SO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.","3","1","1"

We went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!

The atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. 

Service was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. 

Now to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.

That said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. 

The brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. 

The desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. 

Overall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us.","0","0","0"

The gelato was good, but certainly wasn't the best I've had. It was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasn't huge. 

That said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried Twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (creme caramel) was a little boring and lacked flavour. 

My husband had the strawberry, Skor and chocolate. All fine, none blew me away.

Okay, so the gelato is good, if not the ""best""! But perhaps that's being picky. If I'm in the area and want some dessert, this place is great and I can imagine in the summer it's fantastic.

So why the three stars?? First of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large. There is no small option and both of those options are quite large. If you only want a taste of gelato, there is no option for you! 

Secondly, although this place is named for it's gelato, it also specializes in cupcakes. We got a cupcake to bring home. When asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes...and they threw it in a bag. The girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in. Why did you offer then?? But furthermore, YES YOU DO! You literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere! Guess what shape cupcakes are??

Oh well, no biggie.

So, since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes, you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily cupcake. The icing especially. The cake was moist, which is good...except it was SO moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere! 

So what's the final synopsis. This place isn't bad. It has some delicious options. But nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws, which prevent me from giving it a better score. We'll see how I feel if it's a boiling hot summer day and I go in there for gelato though...I may be singing a different tune!","2","0","0"

I purchased a charm from Pandora and it was put directly onto the bracelet. Overnight, I reconsidered one of the charms and wanted to exchange it. I brought it back, with the receipt, but was informed that I couldn't exchange it, because it was on the bracelet. 
I explained that it had been put there BY an employee. The manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me. She said she wouldn't accept a charm that was ""all worn and beat up"". I encouraged her to look at the charm. She could clearly see it was in pristine condition. She glanced at my bracelet as a whole, but did not look at the charm, instead insisting that she could tell.

Seriously lady, you don't stand by your product at all? Your jewellery is so crappy it just gets beaten up and looks like crap after being worn for probably an hour total?!? This wasn't even my fault!!! Plus, she could clearly see from my bracelet that I had spent a LOT of money on my bracelet and am a loyal customer. 

I know that if I had gotten a Pandora box and put the charm in it and brought it back, they would have exchanged it without a problem. I can't now, because I'm sure I would be recognized. Instead I'll go to another location...where perhaps I'll be treated like a valued customer and not a leper. 

I've had bad experiences at this location before. The employees here seem to think customers are beneath them. Each location is independently owned, so needless to say I won't purchase from this location again. Anyone who wants to purchase from Pandora I encourage you to check out the Scarborough or Fairview Mall locations. Always had good experiences at those locations. 

Instead I have sent a complaining email to Pandora head office. We'll see what they respond with.","4","0","0"

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. 

I liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!

To be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return. It certainly wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good either.","2","1","0"

Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. 
Once inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! 
My brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. 
We ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. 
As I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. 
The desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. 
I think everyone left feeling really satisfied. 
It did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.
Basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\/not working. 
That said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!","1","0","1"

It also gives you cravings...often for food you can't possibly get, because they're making some crazy thing across the country that you cannot possibly find a duplicate for. 

Naturally I got a crazy craving for fish and chips...my mistake being that this was a Sunday and for whatever reason, no fish and chip places are open on Sunday. 

I did a lot of looking around, before I found this place, which wasn't too far away and was, most importantly, open! 

This is a quirky place, with wood panelling on the walls and some random fish hung around the place.

Fry's boasts full day breakfasts and the fish and chips. I saw plenty of people coming for the full day breakfasts, which are decently priced and looked pretty good, if nothing special.

We came for the F&Cs though! 

We ordered the single piece, which was MORE than enough food. Quite expensive though. You're looking at around $15\/meal of one large piece of fish and some fries.

It was good, but it wasn't great. Worst of all, the tartar sauce came in sealed packages....ugh.

I'm sorry, but when I'm paying a premium for my fish and chips, at a place named after it's Fish and Chips...I WANT SOME DAMN PROPER TARTAR SAUCE! It's only like the EASIEST thing in the world to make.

Service was fine. No complaints. The waitress did her job...took our order, gave us our food and gave us the bill....that was her job and she did no more and no less.

The restaurant ambiance wasn't there, the food wasn't special and the prices weren't good.

Next time I get a fish and chips craving I'm going to try elsewhere.","1","2","0"

I came again, with my family, for my birthday, at the beginning of October. Even though we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were finally seated and the waiter introduced himself...and then disappeared. Came back ten minutes later and took drink orders and then disappeared for 15 minutes...this continued the entire time. Our dinner took A LONG time. It took forever for our drinks to be served and even longer for our food to come out. Then when the food came out, we got two plates and then waited five minutes for one more plate...then waited another five minutes for another plate. It took our group 15 minutes just for us all to receive the food! Obviously we couldn't eat until everyone had been served and the food was getting cold at that point.

Oh, the best part?? Someone mentioned it was my birthday and the waiter said, ""Oh, so you're a January baby,"" indicating to when I was conceived...to my parents. Yes...thank you sir. I would really like to be reminded of my parents' doing it, right before dinner...because that's completely appropriate. 

So yes, the service this time was TERRIBLE! 

BUT, everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was really good, so there ya have it. Service hit or miss, but food is good.","0","1","1"

We went in and looked at the selection and decided what we wanted and when the person behind the counter asked to take our order and we said we wanted to sit down. He wouldn't take the order and instead had us sit down and look at menus. We explained we knew what we wanted already, but he said he'd be back in a minute. This was fine, we weren't in a rush, but we were both a little confused by the ten minutes we sat there waiting for him. 
When he finally came out, as we were ordering, his cell phone rang and he took the call and walked away, around the corner of the building. We waited for about five minutes for him to finish his call and he finally took our order. Umm...that was some pretty shocking un-professionalism, but we laughed it off and ordered. 

I ordered basic New York cheesecake and my friend ordered an apple cheesecake. Cheesecakes were good, (she really liked her) and we ordered cappuccino and a flavored San Pellegrino and they were good and big sizes, but my cheesecake was a bit frozen in the middle. Knowing it wasn't fresh sort of took away from the experience. 
Anyway, we had a fine time here and the desserts are good, but not great. It was the service that was most disappointing. 

Will I go back?? Yes, if MoRoCo is closed again!","1","0","1"

First of all, I find that this location seems to be sold out of things less often than others. This is an overall problem with the Sephoras in this city - they sell out of things and don't restock often enough. 
One of Sephora's policies is that if you are, at any time, unhappy or unsatisfied with a product, you can return or exchange it.
I bought a cream eyeliner from this Sephora several months ago and used about half of it before it decided to dry out (even though I had been keeping the lid on it). I took it back actually because I was hoping there might be some cream or something I could add, that would make it creamy again. 
No need! They offered to give me a new one, or exchange mine. I chose exchange and they gave me a new brand that they said was excellent AND said they would mention the problem to the sales rep that was coming in for that brand next week. Not that I expect big things to come from that per say, but I'm happy they didn't just blow it off!
My only problem with Sephora (all of them) is that you need to make an appointment in advance to get makeup put on and you are required to spend a certain amount of money, while every other makeup seller does this service for free and accommodates walk-ins. I just hear people asking about it a lot and I had a party to go to one night and was downtown and wanted someone to help me touch up my makeup (without doing it myself using samples in the store) and they were very reluctant to help. You'll sell more things people!!!","2","0","0"

I think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places, mainly because the diversity of toppings. 

I like the fries here, but they're nothing special. Same with the poutine, same with the onion rings (I;ve tried em all). But those burgers are good! No word of a lie!

I think the prices are pretty standard for these types of burger places and service has always been fine for me.

They have a great coke machine...which I know sounds super weird, but you choose your drink...and then can choose the flavour. For example...if I want Fanta, I select that and can then choose any number of Fanta flavours. I always go with a diet cherry coke...where else does that even exist in Canada???! (I'll tell you actually. You can get that at Licks, but they get really confused when you ask for diet coke, instead of regular...they make it themselves). 

Criticisms of the small location are valid. This place is very small and cramped. Not nice to eat in...or even to wait. But it is what it is. They have a mounted flat screen for people to watch and they've done what can can in a super small space.","1","0","0"

Both times I have gone because my normal waxer has been MIA and this place is conveniently close. That said, I find it very expensive, especially for what you get. The first time I went I got the works done...legs, bikini, underarms, etc. The person doing the waxing was very pleasant and kept the conversation going, which I appreciated, but I was still red for DAYS, something I have rarely experienced before in years of waxing. That said, she got the job done. 
Today, however, I had a different girl, who was also very pleasant, but it wasn't until I got home, that I realized what a shoddy job she had done. Patches of hair are still there. I pretty much have to get this redone and I had to pay more to go to this place than any other place I've been to + tip! 
Not only that, but the facility for waxing is pretty pitiful. It's a VERY small room, with the ""bed"" pushed up against a wall. When I went in the summer it was very warm, so I'm not sure if there are A\/C or not. The other wall is entirely windows, which of course always have the blinds closed. It's a weirdly appointed room for a waxing area. Perhaps it was originally a storage closet? With windows?? I don't know, but it's not as though you're going here and paying more because the atmosphere is so much nicer! Anyway, as I said, this place is used in a pinch and now, I'm not sure I'd bother using it for that either!","7","0","0"

There is ONE waitress who works the entire restaurant. The service is hugely lacking as a result.

Last time I went, they had half price appetizers. We were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill....oh, but SHE couldn't subtract the half price from our apps, because she needed the manager, who wasn't there to do it. So she found DIFFERENT items, that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them....well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill, based on items we didn't order????!? It was actually shockingly stupid. 

We all guessed as best we could and threw in cash...I for one threw in the towel too. The food continues to be subpar at best, the prices are not great, even with half price and the service is horrendously terrible. This place is a waste of time and money.","1","4","0"

I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! 

I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small ""mall"" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! 

The decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. 

Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. 

They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. 

Our appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!

The main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!

The lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. 

I had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! 

The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? 

I was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. 

Finally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. 

This place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. 

I will definitely come back some time in the future.","1","0","1"

The service was great and the drinks were a good size and were excellent.

I went with a bunch of friends from work. Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker). 
The ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded. 
I ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for. 
For my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something. 
Now, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat! 
Since we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme brûlée, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme brûlées were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle. 
I was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!

Altogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. 

The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.   

The service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly. 

So, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1\/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5! I would go back in a heartbeat!","2","0","0"

I'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they're really what earned the single star, because they were sweet, but the food was just horrible.

I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or ""real"" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, ""Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?"" He said it was ""good"". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!

My husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.

I asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.

Of course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another. I got regular fries, instead of sweet potato (didn't bother complaining, because I got the free salad, so whatever...like I said, nice server!) My husband's food was fine, although nothing special. They were good with the refills of our drinks.

We ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger. Our food came and was delicious. The soup was probably my favorite part.

I had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good, but the second time was a hot mess. It looked like a five year old did my nails for me. I went home and took the polish off. But this is the kicker:
I couldn't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by, so I decided to give it a try (obviously the nail girl wouldn't be doing my hair). I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, ""..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour..."" right? 
Nope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor looked at my head and ALSO said there was nothing there! 
Since I was paranoid, I still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest I went to examine it. But even with my husband and mother looking at my head, we never found a single thing. We didn't even see dandruff!! I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!
So ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again. No one else should either, unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced.","7","9","0"

I was in Scarborough Town Centre and came upon this kiosk. It's not a storefront, but a rather ingenious booth, with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes. 

There is a long list of flavours and I suspect (as with many places) they make different cupcakes for different days. 

I ordered 6, which was $18...I know, it's steep, that's pretty standard. Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4\/cupcake. So these guys fall somewhere inbetween. But not cheap, so I expect excellence, needless to say.

Now, here's the strange thing. On their website each cupcake is listed as $2.90....was this the case at the store?? I sure hope not. Why would you have to pay MORE for buying more? Maybe it's an ordering online thing? Anyway, my GUESS is that you're paying $3\/cupcake at the store, or $18 for 6. No real incentive to buy 6. But I did, so moving on....

Of course I chose a range of flavours: oreo cookie. chocolate with vanilla icing, salted caramel, lemon and a double chocolate. 

Over two days we managed to work our way through them (myself and my husband) and I nibbled the different flavours. Lemon was my favorite, by far, with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment. It was entirely too salty. More salt than caramel. It wasn't very good at all.

But that said, none of the cupcakes really blew me away. AND in fact, they were VERY stale the next day, despite being stored in an airtight container, in the fridge. Luckily, the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes, they softened up a bit. 

The bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired. 

I was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of Christmas flavours or designed. Right before Christmas you would expect some special flavours...maybe a candy cane, or gingerbread cupcake. It would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a Christmas party dessert. 

Having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea. Sadly, this business is not one I think I will bother with again!","2","0","0"

Yelp) to figure out what we could do, because there is a very real lack of good Mexican food in Toronto. This place had some good reviews and wasn't too far away from us, so off we went.

Parking in Leaside can be pretty brutal, but we finally found a space and luckily, street parking is free. 

The restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated. 

The menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

We ordered the guacamole to start and I ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga. 

The guacamole is very delicious and creamy, but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough. We were really loading up the chips with the guacamole! 

The food came out and the was served with rice, a salad (sort of Italian dressing with feta and tomatoes) and refried beans. The salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland, but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice (I'm a wimp). 

The appetizer and our main courses came to $30 and we were VERY full. 

Service was good and food was good and it wasn't too expensive. It wasn't perfect, but we'll totally be back!","2","0","2"

My husband ordered the Stoney's breakfast, which is your basic eggs, toast, bacon, etc, meal. My mother ordered the omelet. Huge portions, BUT at around $11-$13 per breakfast meal, it was on the steep end of brunches and other than mine, I'm not sure the price is warranted, especially since it's a order at the counter, then find a seat with your number and wait for your meal type place.

I was running errands and hadn't eaten the whole day, so decided to finally give this place a shot. I ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea.

The iced tea doesn't appear to be iced tea. It was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice. It was inedible. It was super gross. I was thinking that maybe they made a mistake, but I can't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order, poured the drink and gave it to me SAID it was iced tea. Sooooo ew. 

Sandwich was alright, but just alright. The ""aroma sauce"" which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good. The bread was good, but the chicken was the sort of cheap, crappy chicken you find at Subway, where it's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat, with fake grill marks on it. It had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich. 

There are soups, salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well, so I'm not writing it off just yet, but this was not a good first impression.","0","0","0"

Also seems to sell a selection of Jamaican movies in DVD from a glass case...sort of random.

Generous with the veggies, less so with dumplings, but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price. I wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup...would be a nice, easy add-on. But this place is what it is and doesn't bother with the bells and whistles. Really deserves a 3.5 stars.

I went here for Sunday lunch with a group for Winterlicious. For $15 we got a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. 

We arrived first and our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu.

Once our party finally arrived we all ordered. I had their Chipotle Sweet Potato & Goat Cheese Dip, which was average. The salads looked much better and got better reviews. Same with the soup. The dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle. The dip was good, the pickled cauliflower alright. It was nice when all combined on the crostini (pickled veggies, dip on top of crostini). 

I had originally wanted to order the double pork slider, but I saw it arrive at someone else's table and it was literally just the one, single mini pork sandwich, with a few thinly cut fries at the side. It looked good, but it was appetizer size, IF THAT. The chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized, so I ordered that. It was good. I really liked the bread. The macaroni was also more reasonably sized. I sampled it and it was fine. Didn't blow me away. 

Dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone I think. Some people ordered the mousse, which I thought was fine, but the people who ordered it loved, so there you have it. My husband loved his apple terrine, which I tried and was good. I liked the flavour of my creme brule very much, but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin, hard candy. It was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth. 

The service was consistently good, so no complaints there. None of us had wine with our lunch (although some had other drinks), so I can't comment there. 

This is a tapas bar, so I expect sizes to be small. BUT when sizes are small I expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions. They gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually. These would all be hard to share and wouldn't really be worth it. They are nice as a Winterlicious meal, but I'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to.","1","0","0"

Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old ""ghetto blasters"" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it...
But the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the squash poutine was a must have, so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak, while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel. The mackerel was served first. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by bulgogi sandwich. Fresh, delicious bread and amazing bulgogi. Was very pleased. Finally the ""poutines"" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. I assumed it would be squash on top of fries. But in fact the squash was the fries. THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce ""gravies"" and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out, nor even see clearly (dim lighting). It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food. 
Other people in our party got the wings, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two ""tapas"" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30. The prices are extremely reasonable...and honestly once you try this stuff...I mean, I don't want to give them any ideas, but I would have paid more for that fine, fine food. I will be back. Need me some more of that poutine!","1","0","1"

Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a ""salad"" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. 
We each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. 
Once we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). 
We asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate. They also served it with a large basket of popcorn, which was just perfectly prepared. It was such a nice after dinner snack! I would totally come here just to order the coffee! 
It would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the coffee was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends. Make sure they're good ones, that you don't mind getting messy in front of!","1","0","0"

Origin is pretty new in our area and is very large, but nicely decorated. My only comment would be the washrooms, which feature communal sinks, the kind you find in elementary schools, where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around. Besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands, it's also wasteful if you're the only one there. Strange concept. Throw back, but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch.  
Now onto the important part...the food and service.
Service started out alright and then immediately got very slow. It took some time to get our drink orders and then took a LONG time to get our actual orders. 
I ordered their French toast, my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger, fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float. I also ordered a side of bacon...and was told that they were out of bacon...which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely, or would be served without bacon. I'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon? Even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous.
We also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves. These were delicious.
Apparently my meal was the one that took the longest. The others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out. Who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves?
My sister said her tostada was quite good. My French toast was nothing special. The toast was ""fancy"", rounded pieces, on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between. The ""maple"" which was supposed to be on the plate (maple syrup I'm guessing) was barely present. Tasted like something I could have created with some ease.
My husband's dish was the best by far. His burger was juicy and this fries were great. The float was a little silly...this big, meaty burger and fries covered in more meat...paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers. (Not insulting, we just got a laugh). 
Nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.
Because the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again. Oliver and Bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch. I might try this again for lunch or dinner though.","0","0","0"

So first off, the store owner responded to my complaints...by blaming me. Apparently it is MY fault they sent the wrong thing, because I sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call...which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something. Which makes zero sense, because two orders were not sent. And the person I was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails I sent with codes to try out....so I have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different. 

They also told me they blocked me on instagram because I was body shaming their models. I want to be VERY clear on this. I never once body shamed, or made any comments on instagram about their models. I asked why they were promoting clothing they don't even have in stock on instagram...apparently that equates to body shaming to them. 

They also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me (3), they were going to start to charge me for shipping. They seemed to forget that I had also been paying to ship items back to them and that I had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders. It's not that they weren't charging me for shipping...it was that I was taking advantage of their own promos. Apparently I can't use their promos anymore, because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now. At least for me. 

They did not address the code not working. 

I responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be. 

Then I did some research and sent another email. Instead of returning the dress I would donate it to Dress for Success. I said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth. My request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good. I asked that they take the remaining $9.98 credit I had and put it towards them making a small donation, either monetarily or a piece of clothing, also to the charity. I stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to, but if they wouldn't do it for me, perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need. I said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness. 

A few hours later I received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to Dress for Success...for the amount of $10 via the store....so my remainder amount I had paid for and Big Sis Closet's contribution of....two cents. Their generosity is astounding. NOW, I don't know that they haven't made their own donation and just not told me of course...I'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service, well...I think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject. No further correspondence was sent from the actual store. 

But at any rate, I am donating the new dress to Dress for Success (along with my $9.98) and I am officially done with this store for good. And I sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here. The clothes are not good quality, but more than that...I have NEVER experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life. Zero regard for their customers, zero regard for their own mistakes, zero regard for taking ownership of...anything! Just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers. These people do not deserve your business and quite frankly...ladies you deserve better. Better clothing (I have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them...loose threads, flimsy, cheap fabric, wrong stitching for the fabric, no lining, incorrect fit for size, etc.) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer.","1","0","0"

It's not the bar's fault the guy knocked the glass, but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in, so it wouldn't have gotten knocked in the first place.

I wish there were a bit more in terms of other desserts besides gelato.

One of my favs, Chimichanga's, has disappeared, so we got to a point where we were just calling around to see WHO could take us. Finally...La Revolucion answered!

We walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!

She took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac). 

The guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!

Burritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. 

The back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: ""...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...""

When we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a ""dance party"". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.

I think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. 

I WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their ""secret recipe"" and were amazing. I had two actually.

Anyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future. Don't think I'll be going for any dance parties!","4","0","0"

My first thought though was that the restaurant was freezing cold inside, but the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was lovely.

She told us the soup of the day, which was potato garlic and said it could be ordered as a side dish. My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.

The soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. 

She was right! It really helped the soup. She said she does this with soups here all the time...which I'm not sure if a very complimentary review of the soups.

My friend said her salad was great and she liked the pepper, but agreed the cheese in the soup made it better. 

So while everything was overall A-Okay, it wasn't fantastic. It's solid though and I would go back and try something else another time.","1","0","0"

We ordered two pizzas and split them. One pizza = a good size meal for a person, so we were stuffed and happy at the end.

Service was good and pizzas came out fast and fresh from the oven. Nice, crispy crusts and gooey centres. Yummy!

The waiter accidentally dropped a fork on me when he was taking away our plates and apologized profusely. No biggie....particularly because he was so apologetic. (Let's face it, if someone makes a small mistake, but acts like ""it ain't no thang"" we get a little turned off).

Firstly, I should mention that the menu is very small. Most of the food has an Italian feel to it (it IS in Little Italy), but that feels a bit strange given the huge martini list. 

We were hungry though, so we ordered dinner and it was honestly pretty good! I'm not sure if this would be my choice if I was JUST looking for dinner out, but not bad if you're feeling lazy, and not wanting to bother going somewhere different for your alcohol and food, like what we were feeling. 

This is a martini bar and so no big surprise, it has a lot of martinis. That said, I shall repeat it...it has a LOT of martinis!! Over 100 different martinis and every one of the ones I tried, I enjoyed. And I tried a good five or something. This may ALSO account for my remembering a good time.

The service was good too. When I mentioned that I really liked the sauce my pasta came in, the waiter brought me extra sauce in a dish, with bread to dip it in. Weird, but I really enjoyed this...what can I say? I had had like 5-6 martinis!

Then they called back a few minutes later because they needed directions to our place. 
We proceeded to get three more calls from a driver asking us where to go. The confusing thing was that he would ask, but then either carry on a conversation on another phone, or with someone who was with him, instead of listening. Then he would ask for my husband to repeat himself. This happened at least twice every call, for three calls. 

Turns out they took the address down completely wrong. Big surprise, considering their listening skills. 

We finally got our food and they had screwed up the order and given us a wrong sushi roll. Either way the sushi was among the worst we have tasted. It was a mixture of bland and salty! Basically it was terrible. 

On a side note, their dragon rolls are actually unagi rolls. Dragon rolls are called dragon rolls (at EVERY other sushi place) because they have avocado on top, making them green. It is very strange that these guys have decided that that's not the way they want to go.

I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. 

The four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and pâté), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. 

The dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the ""ugly"" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. 

Next was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. 

We had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. 

Finally we had the tacos, which was probably the more ""normal"" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. 

The foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. 

So what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.

Overall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. 

Those are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! 

Oh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash.","0","0","0"

Cafe Polonez was in a great little area, with lots of nice, little shops surrounding it and High Park, of course. 

The restaurant is clean and trendy looking and we took a seat, against the wall, in the back. We ordered the platter for two. Since we had never been, it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out. GREAT idea! We were delivered a platter of food that included two schnitzels, two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies and some other sides. Everything was great, but the schnitzel and cabbage rolls in particular were excellent! I ordered two gravies to go with the schnitzel, expecting two, little Swiss Chalet-sized gravies, but instead we got two, huge bowls of gravy. Needless to say, one bowl would have been more than enough for 2 people. They were only $1 apiece, so not the end of the world. 

Plenty of food for two people and a great sampler platter to see what they have and what you like.

Service was fast and good and everything was excellent. Totally recommend it and I'll be back. Just thinking about it is making me salivate!","2","0","0"

I should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal ""current Toronto"" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! 

The skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. 

We stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!

Why the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table. Your coats end up...wherever basically. 

Probably because I booked the tickets on the Wednesday before (I'm not sure how they determine seats...it's not first come, first served and it's not on your ticket...that I could see), we originally ended up in a back corner, on high bar stools. My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. 

That said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. 

BUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! 

At the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance. It's worth a night of non-stop laughter.","0","0","0"

We went and had our breakfasts, which was served by a rather surely waitress and was average. If this had been our only experience, I would have given three stars, but another night we got in very late and were just looking for a late dinner and found ourselves at this place.
It was not very crowded, but was as loud as if three times as many people were there. There was a small group of trashy (very obese people), scream\/singing karaoke on a stage in the front of the restaurant. One of them was singing Eminem and the others were screaming and cheering. We sat down in the back, to try and avoid the chaos, but it was way too disruptive. Other people sitting there, who were in the middle of their dinners and therefore stuck there, were looking pained. We didn't bother putting ourselves through this and left. It's a crappy menu, that's overpriced anyway.
I guess Rock and Rita's name really says it all, but basically if you're not a fall-down, cheap drunk, I don't think you'll have much to say about this place.","2","1","0"

Why? Well for starters, the gentleman who owns the establishment is lovely and personable. I think their portions are large and the fish to be yummy and not too bland, or overly breaded. I also really like that they make their OWN tartar sauce. So few places seem to do this. You get like 1-2 of those little packets. 
One star off for having to buy the tartar sauce separately, and for it being rather small portions. I KNOW tartar sauce is not that premium of an item...why does no one include it in the price, or at least give a nice, proper portion? Such a small thing to make a big difference.
That said, this is my first choice in the area. Would be interested in trying their pork souvlaki, but when you're going to the fish and chips place...it's sort of a given to get the fish and chips.","0","0","0"

I'm a little confused by the earlier reviews...well...I'm confused by ONE earlier review. But then again, not really, because some people are...well...the way they are! Whatcha gonna do??

As with traditional Italian restaurants (both in the city AND in Italy), the waiters do not coddle you. 

Anyway, the service was great. We had a very attentive waiter. He asked us where we would prefer to sit and we chose a seat for two, but the window. 

The menu is extensive, with a lot of choice. I was debating between a couple of dishes, so my friend suggested we order two things and share. She ordered a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza. 

While we waited for the main course, we were given a basket and soft bread and oil and vinegar...mmmmmmmm....

Our food came out and both dishes were DELICIOUS! The pasta was great, the sauce was especially good. The pizza had mozzarella and goat cheese and veggies...goat cheese on pizza = perfecto! 

We had leftovers....and then we decided to hell with self control and ate them. 

Needless to say, we were too stuffed for dessert. Shame, because they looked very good.

Turns out that this is not the first time I have had food from here. The same friend, used these guys to cater a party she had. She had some large trays of pasta and I remember really enjoying them...you know, as far as catered food goes (to please everyone, they had gotten pastas on the plainer side). 

I think this is a good, solid place. Prices are what you would expect for the food and area.

Why missing one star? I've still had better Italian in the city....I'm picky enough that I need to be REALLY blown away to award 5 stars. 

That doesn't mean this isn't a good place, worth checking out though!","8","0","0"

One girl did my toenails and did a nice job, although I loved the colour and the sticker at the bottom of it was missing, so I have no idea what colour I am wearing, should I want to use it again.

The woman doing my nails wasn't as good as the woman doing my toes though. First of all she kept making comments about how small my nails are. I'm an art teacher, so having long nails is really not to my benefit, but thanks for bringing this up constantly! She was also a bit rough. She blamed it on my fingers being tensed, but honestly, they were tense because it hurt! It started becoming a vicious circle!

I think that the amount of gel she put on was WAY too much. Some nails you can see the dip made in the gel. Also, I have only had them a week and I feel like they can be easily ripped off. Things keep getting caught in the edges.

The colour is nice and there was a good selection of colours to choose from, but as I stated before, if you really need something done, here is great, because it's HERE, not because of what a great job they do!","6","1","1"

You get a card when you go in...different colour for eating in, or taking out. Then you go around and order your food from different booths and they swipe your order, adding it to the card. If you're eating there, you can sit down with your caf trays, or they will package your food up to go.

You can get pasta, roast beef and other meats, pizzas. The reason I would go would be for the schnitzel, which is quite good. But they ALWAYS run out. And honestly, NOTHING else here is very good. You can make your own pasta, but it's all very generic tasting and uninspired. 

The prices are NOT good for what you get, but they aren't four $, like what is currently showing below. Nothing close to that. Someone is grossly exaggerating.

I had never been in before, because the price list was pricey, but decided that given my rush, I would bite the bullet and suck it up.

The people were all very pleasant. I said I was wearing a purple dress and asked for feedback on colours and they gave good opinions and were very nice. Then I was led into a back rooms, where I was instructed to sit on a padded bench and put my feet in a large, metal bowl of water. THIS was a new one. I have never had to put my feet in a mixing bowl while getting nails done.

The seat, while padded, was not particularly comfortable and it was awkward getting up on it and off it again. The pedicure was standard with most places I have been.

The nails were more in keeping with what I was used to, sitting at a nail table. I said I was in a bit of a rush, but she still seemed to really take her time. I didn't push it, because I didn't want to be rude. The nails were fine, but not perfect...some have some bubbling in the polish and others are a bit crooked.

Here's the kicker though...the bill came to $60!! That's almost twice as much as other nail places and it's certainly not a better place in terms of the facilities and job they do! That doesn't even include tip.

The people in there were all older and seemed to be regulars, so I guess they have a customer base, but I certainly won't be part of that! Even in a rush, this place was just not worth it. There are a number of nail salons popping up in the area as it continues to get built up. They better watch themselves, because with so many other options there is no reason to go here.","3","1","1"

They informed us this was because it was almost close, although close wasn't till 7pm...so I guess this is more of a lunch place. That said they had one veal left and one penne pasta left. We bought them both. My toddler, who hates pasta usually, loved this pasta! And I agree with him. It was delicious. My husband liked the sandwich and I also took a bite and it was yummy.

We also bought some very expensive gelato, which was good (and apparently no preservatives, all natural, etc) but was very pricey at over $20 for the smallish tub. The sign in front of the gelato said large takeaway tub was $10...my husband paid, or I would have asked for clarification. I didn't know until after we left, so there was some miscommunication somewhere in there.

I find that sometimes you get great service the first few times and then they bomb completely. This salon was sort of average the first few times and bombed the third. 

I decided to go to this place  back in the fall, as I was looking for a new stylist. A girl from work goes to this place and said it was pretty good, so I figured I've give it a try. I went in with some different pictures and asked if I should go lighter with some highlights, or darker. The girl said darker, for no real apparent reason and dyed my hair dark brown. Not a hard job and it was fine. 

Second time I went back I wanted some highlights. A had a different girl this time and she gave me partial highlights and then a wash, which made the highlights barely noticeable. Then, because of the wash, it cost around $150! I thought again, it was fine. 

Third time, I wanted something a little more noticeable. I said I specifically wanted my highlights to stand out more this time. I wanted to avoid paying extra, for hardly any change. I brought in pictures and the same girl as last time got to work. 

When she was finshed I was not impressed with the results. There were very noticeable roots all around my head. Especially if you pulled my hair back from my ears, there were dark strips where the roots were and the highlights began. It was not natural. I complained about the roots, so she proceeded to take big sections of hair and bleach them completely, then rubbed the bleach off with a damp towel. It barely looked different when she had finished, but the store was basically past closed and it was clear she had no idea how to fix this mess anyway. 

I had to go and purchase one of those root touch-ups from Shoppers Drug Mart and fix my roots myself. After that, they were alright. Once again it was very expensive.

My friend has been going with me the last few times and I think she has liked her hair, but I won't be going back. I would have to ask specifically for a new stylist and I just don't want the awkwardness and frankly, I just don't trust anyone there anymore anyway. Once again, the search is on!","5","0","1"

Overall, our experience was fine and I would probably try it again, but I won't be rushing back. We called to make reservations. I asked for 7 or 7:30 and was told that 7:30 ""would be better"". Assuming that meant 7 was a busy time, we went to the area and were prepared to wander around for a bit...but the restaurant was almost empty, so we went in and were seated promptly. 

Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders. I had the mussels and my husband had the salad. Both were good, although the mussels were quite spicy, something I wish was specified before ordering. 

My husband ordered the pork hock and I had the pasta. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited sauce had little flavour. The chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a ""good"" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied. 

When the server gave us our bill, she took away my husband's beer that he was not finished with. We didn't notice until it was too late. 

All this said, I saw other dishes that looked pretty amazing, my husband's food was much better than mine, and despite the beer stealing, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere made for a nice date spot.

As I said below, when I went to Moroco, it was expensive, but very delicious for a treat. So I decided that I wanted to have my birthday dessert there. I called up to make a reservation for about 10 people. I was informed that for groups of over ten, there is a requirement that every person spends $48! 

I kept the reservation for a day to see how many people were actually going to confirm coming out, but since everyone confirmed, I had to call back and cancel my reservation, because I do not want my guests to be obliged to spend $50 on dessert, after we have already had dinner! The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??! 

I have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are! No thanks! Chocolate is great there, but only go with a couple of people, otherwise you'll have to pay the price!

(Original reviews: Oh my gosh, this place is to DIE for. It's also crazy expensive! This isn't a ""daily treat during the work day"" place, it's a ""I'm celebrating something and want a very special treat"" place. Deserts are around the $18\/person range.

That said, the atmosphere was amazing. The place is all in black and white and looks\/feels very trendy. The desserts though....WOW. Amazing! Chocolate fondue that is heavenly!

We had quite a large group, so we got a variety of pizzas and split them. This was tricky because the pizzas were all divided into four pieces each. Even though we said we were splitting them all, no one seemed to think to split them up a bit more. 

They were also quite slow with the service, especially taking our order initially. 

But, as I said, the pizzas we ordered were very good. Some stranger combinations were a big hit, like the pear pizza, which worked a bit like a dessert.

NOW, I just want to state that I cannot CONFIRM that it was this place that gave it to me, but let's just say that I had only eaten finger foods at a bridal shower prior to coming here and shortly after dinner I got sick in the middle of a concert. Super fun AND convenient!

The service was good and this is why this place got the extra star. The guy was truly nice and the service quite fast. 

You wouldn't think the food would make you sick, because it was very bland.  Tasted like something I could have made myself very easily. I ordered the chicken burrito and I found it was quite dry. THey didn't include any sour cream or guacamole, even on the side, so it was just rice and beans and chicken. 

The atmosphere was cute enough, so perhaps as a place to go after work for drinks, but be wary.","0","0","0"

Poutine was good...had pulled chicken on it and was tasty, although not entirely unique tasting, but that's fine for this type of place. I had the ODB and it was AMAZE-BALLS! The chicken was a huge portion, on a full waffle. The waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart. It had a great sauce on top and the slight kick, blended with the sweetness of the waffle, was a great mix. Portion size was good, food was delicious. Came with a little cup of potato salad...liked the peas, nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish.

So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh. 

One recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself. 

THE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. 

And it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. 

You are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. 

This is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food. 

I would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was. Basically, you could be in dirty, dank basement storage room and you'd never know! 

Finally, it's very expensive! 

I found that I liked it to try once and say I've done it, but it's gimmicky and that doesn't translate well into a place that will become a go-to favorite. Once is enough for me!","2","0","0"

Several months ago I had a hankering for bagels. I decided to give What a Bagel a try and was pleased with their prices (exactly $6 for a dozen bagels) and the taste. They were really, very good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a variety of flavours to choose from. 

But I had this nagging feeling, because it wasn't a ""traditional Jewish bagel shop"". I swore I wouldn't give a full judgement until I had sampled bagels from Bagel World. Bagel World, which has a few locations in the city, boosts the best bagels IN the city. They also have weird hours though, making it hard to get to on a weeknight.

I finally made it there and grabbed four bagels. My husband and I eagerly sampled the first two...and were VERY disappointed. (See full review under Bagel World). 

SOOO What a Bagel wins! Never thought I would be saying that about a major bakery chain!","2","0","0"

Decor: Another reviewer mentions that the decor seems to be missing something and I agree. It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. 

Food: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. 
My husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. 

Atmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child\/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place). Another situation where children were screaming and running around and parents were sitting off, by themselves, ignoring them, while the rest of the people in the restaurant had to suffer. The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. 

Once again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. 

We were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.

So yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars. That said, it just didn't do it for me. Overpriced, for only okay food and poor atmosphere.","2","1","0"
"VuN5MT-_Joud-2NnzY6cSg","nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ","4KHo1LnkM69RtWTDBdG16g","1","2012-11-11","I am just perplexed by the good reviews of this place. Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. 

We have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.

First impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. 

Menu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. 

We both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. 

My drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. 

My soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. 

My husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. 

His drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.

We finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. 

We REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. 

We flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special.

Once we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. 

Finally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. 

So yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. 

One another note, another review says, ""If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out."" I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of ""Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out"" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well.

I have rented from them before, but never gone to actually pick things up before. I found the staff friendly, knowledgeable and their prices reasonable.
My only criticism would be that the area for renting equipment is small and shabby and they (for some unknown reason) had to get our rental approved by management, I guess because we're a school, even though we're in the system and have rented many times before. We had to wait to get in touch with someone on the phone. It was annoying and seemed unnecessary. Obviously it's some weird policy, so I don't blame the workers or anything.

Since I have been several times and never had a bad experience, I can only give my review of this place based on what I have experienced. 

That said, it seems like so many people have experienced bad service, that even I am wary of this place now. I have never been during ""peak"" hours, which may account for more attentive service.

As mentioned, I have been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed myself. I love Mexican food and there doesn't seem to be enough good Mexican restaurants around, so I get excited when I find one with food I enjoy.

I have had their nachos, two types of tacos and a burrito at this place and enjoyed all of them. When I went with a girlfriend, we were advised to get two taco plates and share them, since they give you a few, small tacos on each plate. We did this and really enjoyed both dishes. 

The nachos were also great, having been piled high with toppings, not just your grated cheese and some tomatoes. 

Drinks were also good. I guess my one criticism would be the price, which I do think is a little high given that Mexican food is quite cheap to produce. I am guessing that the extra cost goes towards the atmosphere, which is trendy...but I gave this same review to another Mexican restaurant I went to in Florida and it looked like someone's kitchen, so I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.","2","0","2"

My sister had really hyped the tam-tams to me, so I went in a bit skeptical....but she was right! 

I can't really explain why this was so fantastic, especially because really it's a bit ridiculous. 

This is a big park and I don't know it well enough to direct people to where exactly you need to go, but by the large monument (the one featured on the picture for this attraction), you will find a group of drummers that set up here every Sunday. Depending on the day, there may be more, or less. Apparently the group can get pretty huge, but either way, they all gather around in a sort of circle...and drum! 

The environment is very ""come-as-you-are"" (read: hippy), but it's such a laid back and accepting atmosphere. The drummers just sort of jam together, playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos. People go and dance in the middle...kids go and pound on the drums...lots of people get high! 

Even not high, this is a pretty fun thing to watch. It's mesmerizing somehow. Again, I can't explain what made this so great. We just sat back in the beautiful weather, snacked on our bagels and watched the craziness unfold around us.

My husband and myself went to Sail and were looking for a place to pick up some dinner...just grab and go, since I had no groceries at home...but also didn't have the energy to go grocery shopping. I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, ""There is this good place nearby named Ricci's."" That sealed the deal. Off we went.

The outside is hardly something to look at. The sign is faded and dirty and it looks, outside, like it's a dive. We went in a saw a modestly busy place, clean and a HUGE menu. You can eat in (seating is limited and similar to fast food seating), can get delivery, or get take out. 

The menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK. We also got the rice balls.

Okay, rice balls first: Lightly breaded, gooey cheese on the inside and sauce for dipping them in....SO GOOD.

The panzerotti...well this is where they lose one star...not on the food itself, but because they messed up our order. One order was covered in a sheet of wax paper with the toppings listed on the inside...it was mine. But after a few bites I noticed, I was actually eating my husband's. We switched and then i noticed there were no toppings in mine at all! Just cheese and sauce. So they were mislabelled AND the order was messed up. 

But OH LORDY, was that a great panzerotti anyway. Just melt in your mouth awesome....and that's after a 30 minute drive home! 

I called up Ricci's and explained what happened and said I was too far away to come in again or to have something delivered and they gave me a credit for the panzerotti. The girl on the phone apologized and was very polite. So they fixed the problem to the best of their ability and it was amazingly delicious. Next time if I go back and the order it great...and not messed up, I think I'll have to bump these guys up another star!

Well my curiosity has been satisfied and I'm sure I'll never feel the need to visit this place again.

It struck me as a typical trendy place that yuppies feel they need to visit as all the other yuppies do.  
""Oh the food is sooo good!!""
""Really? You've eaten there?""
""No. But all my yuppy friends have and they say it's good so it must be.""

I only give it a two because the service and presentation of the food was decent.

We ordered something called oxtail fries which were horrible. I'm sure an actual oxtail would probably have been tastier.

My girlfriend and I each ordered a different burger so we could sample each others. Sorry I can't remember what they were called but we didn't care for either one. The best compliment I could pay them is to say they were at least edible.

So as mentioned the service was decent and the food looked presentable but as far as taste I can't recommend this place. 

Perhaps it's just me. Maybe the asian fusion just isn't my type of food. 

I'd rather have a Wendys burger over this place.","5","3","2"

You can find all the details of the hike at http:\/\/www.birdandhike.com\/Hike\/Other_Areas\/Lone_Mt\/_Lone_Mt.htm

It's a steep 600 foot climb. Hiking poles would come in handy as there are some really steep spots where it's easy to slip on loose rocks. 

The climb up is not too dangerous. Most slips will only result in scratches and bruises but watch your step at the summit. The top is very narrow a slip here could be disastrous. 

Make sure you bring plenty of water. I'd avoid hiking this in the summer as there is absolutely no shade any where.","5","0","2"

I had the small order of chicken and waffles. This was the first time I've tried this combination of sweet and salty. I've seen chicken and waffles reviewed on different food shows and it looked interesting. Apparently it's a popular item down south.

I found it good and I'd order it again. 

One of my companions had the meatloaf and he said it was awesome!

I did notice other patrons food orders were very large. So you apparently get your moneys worth here and the prices seemed good as well. Most items on the menu seemed to be around ten dollars.

To be honest I haven't eaten in a Sonic in forever. So parking at one of their little ordering machines I got out of my car and was about to walk in because I didn't know if I could order food to go while parked at one of their ordering machines. Also I'm sure there is a better name then ""ordering machine""...maybe ordering station, vending space???? I'm sure if you've ever been to one you know what I'm referring to.

Anyway a young lady comes outside to tell me how a Sonic works. I could order from a machine outside to eat at one of their tables, or I could eat in my car while parked at one of their ordering stations, or they actually have a drive through.  I'm sure she must have wondered what was up with the ""old guy"" who didn't know how a fast food joint worked. Anyway she was kind and polite and did her best not to make me feel like a absent minded ""old guy""

Weighing my options I decided to use their drive through. I ordered a couple hot dogs. One mustard only and a Chicago style dog. A order of tater tots and a number 1 which is just a classic burger, fries and a drink.

As is typical for a fast food joint it was staffed with a very young group of people. What was not typical for a fast food joint is they actually got my order right.

It's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.

After perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53

I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.

We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.

Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.

The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!

The two guys working the front counter had the enthusiasm of a couple of rocks. It looked like it was an effort for them to even take a step. I understand it's probably not the best job in the world but there are people like me who recruit our employees from people we run into during our day to day activities. These two have zero chances of being recruited to work somewhere else.

I also had to ask for the fries that went with my combo. I got them, but only after a heavy sigh from one of the two at the counter. You would have thought I'd asked him to come outside and change my tire rather then just asking them for a bag of fries.

The food was mediocre, probably a three. But the lack of enthusiastic service definitely drops it to a two.","1","0","0"

Upon looking up places in Vegas where I could purchase and learn about them I found this place.

I noticed several reviews mentioning they felt uncomfortable because the employees were keeping an eye on them. Well this is not the best part of town. And they are just trying there best to prevent theft.

At one point we were checking out one of the aisles and the owner, John, walked on over to check us out. I introduced myself and explained what I was looking for. He was a nice guy and we had a enjoyable short talk. All the time he was keeping his eye on some shady looking character in the store. I can't blame him.

I also saw mention of them being over priced. This may or may not be the case but he's trying to make a decent profit like all of us. If you know the price you want to pay and his stuff is to high then look elsewhere.

I've been out here a half a dozen times over the years and have always loved this place.

It's not far from Vegas but due to it's lack of paved roads it doesn't get the type of visitation like RedRock Canyon or Mt Charleston. That's probably a good thing.

It's always been a great place to bring the dogs and let them off the leash to run around a bit. There were so few people no one seemed to care.

Well apparently that's changing I was out there today and there is a lot of construction going on. Looks like they're building a large visitor center.

What once was a large pond has been drained and the water is now in a large concrete pond.

What were once nice winding dirt paths can now best be described as winding sidewalks. It looked like hard concrete with dirt sprinkled on top.

And we were told twice by a park manager to keep our dogs on a leash. Guess this guy is instructed to snoop in the bushes and harass dog owners.

Oh well I know lots more beautiful places where no one harasses my dog.

It's still a lovely place and I'm sure non dog owners will love it.","4","1","1"

We ordered the Maui Wowie Pizza, an Original Cheesteak sandwich a order of wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda. The total was just over $40.00

The guy who took the order over the phone was friendly, the delivery guy was friendly. The food arrived in about 30 minutes.

As far as the food goes, for the price,  I was hoping it would be tastier than it was.

The wings and sandwich were pretty good. I wasn't as impressed with the pizza. 

It wasn't bad, but I really wasn't overly impressed. I'll probably try it again at some point in the future.","2","0","0"

I did a search for ""delivery"" on Yelp to see what would turn up. Lo and behold I discovered this place was fairly close to me and I'd never tried it.

So having had a few beers and few shots of tequila I figured what the hell I'll give it a try. 

I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza a order of wings and a bottle of Pepsi. The food was at my door quicker than any delivery I've ever had!

I'm very picky about wings. Most places seem way under cooked for my taste. These wings were great. My only complaint was they had just a bit two much sauce on them. I'd probably strain them next time just to let a bit of it drip off. But they were really tasty!

The pizza was great! So good in fact this is gonna be my new pizza place to order from.

I only ordered a medium one last night as it was the first time I'd ordered from them. It was so good last night that I ordered a large one for breakfast LOL seriously. I'm typing this as I await it's arrival. I'm just waiting to hit the post button until it arrives in case they're slower this time.

First of all keep in mind this isn't one of the better areas of town. You wouldn't want to walk around the area at night.

I've driven by here many times during the day and have always seen a large line waiting to get in. Because of this we came in the evening to check it out. There was no line and we were able to walk right in.

It's much smaller than it appears on tv. It also didn't seem as clean as it is on tv.

Visiting it in person it's really not that impressive. Just a small store with a variety of stuff for sale. They did have a small section that sells Pawn Stars memorabilia.

I work on the strip at one of the hotels and have spoken with many tourists who have visited this place. According to what I've heard the characters you see on the show are rarely working there. This was the case on the evening of our visit as well.

So if you're a big fan of the show it might be worth a visit but be assured the place is more entertaining on television than it is in person.","22","0","0"

I work down on the strip and knowing the kind of riff raff that hangs out around here I wasn't expecting much from this experience. As soon as I stepped into the place my expectations were fulfilled.

We each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu. Both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty. I do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool.

I felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed. Strange as this is the same complaint I had about the one I visited yesterday.

We'd never eaten here and thought we'd give this place a try. Peeking my head inside to see what the place looked like I noticed a peculiar smell. Not totally unpleasant just different. I thought we'd give it a try anyway, but opted to sit at one of the outside tables.

I did use the restroom while here and found it to be clean and sanitary.

We both ordered our meals. I ordered the club sandwich, My girl ordered a gyro. Both meals came some sort of a thick chicken rice soup with a lemon taste. The soup was good until my girl discovered a hair in hers. That kind of turned me off on eating anymore of it. We let that slide cause a random hair can happen now and then.

The sandwich was very good as was the gyro. Both servings were very large and filling. Neither of us could finish them. The waitress, after learning we planned on being in Boulder City for awhile, offered to put the leftovers in the fridge for us to pick up later. We declined but it was nice of her to offer.

So other than a hair in the soup and a little odor, which may be because it's an old building, not a bad place for lunch.","1","0","0"

I had the Rambo Burger and my girlfriend had the Cheesy Burger. Both items were awesome. I was a little worried that the fries wouldn't be to good having read some of the reviews. We found them to be just fine. No complaints from us.

Our waitress was great. Polite, friendly and quick. 
The food was good. Loved the green salsa on the tacos.

We were a little upset that they didn't serve a blended margarita, but the ones they did serve were pretty good.

The major negative was how noisy the place was. Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs. 

I'd visit here again. Hopefully next time it's a little quieter and perhaps they'll invest in a blender so they can blend their margaritas.","1","0","0"

I work in the area so have visited this location many times. 

Being Las Vegas it goes without saying that they're overpriced. They're also usually under staffed. In the morning you can expect a long wait for your coffee.

Other than these negatives they do ok for being in a casino environment.","0","0","0"

We'd never visited a place like this before and didn't have high expectations for getting much for our old gold.

We found them to be very polite and the guy who purchased our gold from us was very informative. I was curious as to how they determined the value of the gold. He proceeded to show us the acids that were used in the process and explained it all to us.

As an added bonus we were pleasantly surprised at what our old gold was valued at. We got the cash and ended up having a fun evening on the town thanks to some old, broken gold pieces that would have other wise just laid in the bottom of a drawer for years to come.","1","0","0"

This was the worst I've seen. Boring Boring Boring. I guess for being in a major hotel I expected a lot more out of it.

I've seen smaller shows in smaller venues that were more entertaining. They were probably less expensive to put together put at least it was fun seeing the performers put their all into a low budget production.

I spent a fair chunk of the show visiting with the bartender. He was more entertaining than the show.

Don't waste your money on this show. From a local I can tell you for a fact that there are much better ways to blow your money in this town.","4","1","1"

If you're a member of the younger crowd 21-35 you'll probably love this place. If you're looking for a quite place to get away and have a drink this is not the place.

Friday and Saturday nights, as well as many evenings, the place is so packed it's hard to find a spot at the bar.

You'll find a lot of kids yelling and screaming acting as if it's the first time they've ever had a drink.

As for there food I've tried most everything on the menu and every time it's been a disappointment.

The staff is usually very friendly and attentive.

So although I go here on a regular basis I wouldn't give it high marks. But like I said if you're younger and want to hang out with a louder crowd you'll probably enjoy this place.","0","0","0"
